In this project, you will learn how to deploy a high-availability Node.js web app using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon DynamoDB. The sample app you will deploy uses Node.js, Express, and a NoSQL database. Using Elastic Beanstalk, you can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales your application up and down based on your application's specific need using easily adjustable Auto Scaling settings. Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models. If you use the sample app, you will also use Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to configure push notifications for your app.

[ Get Started with the Project Guide][46]

**What you'll accomplish:**

**Launch a Node.js web application environment** using [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][52] and [Amazon DynamoDB][53]. Elastic Beanstalk provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances) and stack components (e.g., OS, web server, language/framework) for you. DynamoDB provides the NoSQL database.

**Deploy your web application** using [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][52]**.** You'll upload your code to Elastic Beanstalk, which handles all deployment details for you.

**Receive email notifications** with [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)][54]. If you use the sample app, you will receive notifications from SNS each time someone writes a record to your DynamoDB table.  

**What you'll need before starting:**  

**An AWS Account:** You will need an AWS account to begin provisioning resources to host your website. [Sign up for AWS.][55]

**IT Experience:** A basic understanding of web technologies and Node.js is recommended, but not required, to complete this project.

**AWS Experience:** No prior experience with AWS is required to complete this project.

**Code (Optional)**: If you have code for your application, you can deploy it using this guide. You can also use the sample app code provided in this project.  

**Billing Estimates:**  

**Cost to complete project**: The estimated cost to complete this project is $0.04. This cost assumes that you are within the [AWS Free Tier][56] limits, you follow the recommended configurations, and that you terminate all resources within 1 hour of completing the project. Your use case may require different configurations that can impact your bill. Use the [Simple Monthly Calculator][57] to estimate costs tailored for your needs

**Monthly billing estimate**: The total cost of launching and running a Node.js web application will vary depending on your usage and configuration settings. Using the default configuration recommended in this guide, it will typically cost around $28/month within the AWS Free Tier. To see a breakdown of the services used and their associated costs, see [Services Used and Costs][49].
